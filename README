Object::Result version 0.000002

    This module adds a new keyword to Perl: "result"

    That keyword acts like a "return", but instead of a list of values to
    return, it takes a single block which specifies the behaviour (i.e. the
    methods and operator overloading) of an object to be returned.

    The intention is to make it much less onerous to return clean, properly
    encapsulated objects...instead of returning lists of values or
    references to arrays or hashes.
